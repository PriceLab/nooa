<h4> Basic Design and Operation</h4>

A gene name takes on different meanings in different contexts, for example:
<ul>
  <li> in an RNA-seq experiment,  a gene name refers to mRNA expression
  <li> in a metabolic pathway,  the enzyme for which it codes
  <li> in a pubmed search,  a list of journal artices in which the gene is prominently  mentioned
  <li> in a database of homology, orthologous genes foundin other species
</ul>

This webapp facilitates the exploration of these multiple meanings.
Proceed by first selecting your desired destination from the pulldown menu.
Then use your mouse to select a gene row in the table.

<p>
Some immediately relevant &amp; curated information is presented directly in the table.
Other information and explorations are available when you send a gene to one of
the other tabs.
