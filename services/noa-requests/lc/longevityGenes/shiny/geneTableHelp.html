<h4> Basic Design and Operation</h4>

A gene name takes on different meanings in different contexts.  For example:
<ul>
  <li> in an RNA-seq experiment,  a gene name refers to mRNA expression
  <li> in a metabolic pathway,  for the enzyme for which it codes
  <li> in a pubmed search,  a list of journal artices in which the gene is prominently  mentioned
  <li> in a database of homology, orthologous genes foundin other species
</ul>

This webapp facilitates the exploration of these multiple meanings.
Click in the table row for your gene of interest, and all of the tabs will be populated.
<p>
These tabs are currently avaialble:
<ul>
  <li> <b>Gene Table</b>: summary information 1010 genes, curated by the LC
  <li> <b>GeneCards</b>: Per-gene diverse information from the Weizmann Institute
  <li> <b>HomoloGene</b>: Cross-species orthologs from NCBI
  <li> <b>Curated Pubmed</b>: Articles selected by the LC
  <li> <b>Pubmed Gene+Longevity</b>: Fresh search of PubMed 
  <li> <b>Orthologs</b>: Curated by the LC
  <li> <b>Notes &amp; Comments</b>: A shared google doc for all to use

</ul>

  
<p>
Some immediately relevant &amp; curated information is presented directly in the table.
Other information and explorations are available when you send a gene to one of
the other tabs.
