  <ul>
    <li> This is an early prototype.  
    <li> When possible, the app displays externally-obtained web pages (GeneCards, Homologene) in iframes
      embedded within the app.
    <li> For most websites, the iframed-web page we present is fully functional: you can click to follow
      links found on the page.
    <li> <b>Beware!</b> Some websites (NCBI in particular) prohibit this, and so <b>shift-click</b>
      on these links is required,   and the resulting page will appear in a new browser window.
    <li> We display pubmed searches in summary form.  The full pubmed view of any article requires the
      above mentioned <b>shift-click</b>.
    <li> If a single pubmed id is passed to the PubMed tab, we double it up, so that the
      iframed web page we obtain from NCBI is an index page providing links to the
      PubMed abstract and summary.  These links can only  be followed with <b>shift-click</b>.
