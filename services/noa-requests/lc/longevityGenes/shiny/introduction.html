    <li> This is an early prototype.
    <li> We depend on early adopters to help us shape this into a useful tool.
    <li> The next significant addition is a user-curation capability:
      <ul>
	<li> propose a gene &amp; organism of interest
        <li> provide whatever annotations, references and comments you wish
        <li> this becomes a provisional entry, promoted soon to a curated entry
      </ul>

    <li> If you have any omments or suggestions, please send add them to the google doc in the
         <i>Notes &amp; Comments</i> tab
  </ul>
